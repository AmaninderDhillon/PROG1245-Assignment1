            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Katherine Johnson</b> (August 26, 1918 &hyphen; February 24, 2020) was an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. During her 33-year career at NASA and its predecessor, she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks. The space agency noted her historical role as <em>one of the first African-American women to work as a NASA scientist.</em>
